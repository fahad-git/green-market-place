## Project Structure

The project consists of a **single repository** hosting both backend and frontend codebases.

### 1. **Backend**
- **Framework**: Built on **Express.js**.
- **Database**: Uses **MongoDB** for storing data.
- **Environment Configuration**: The `.env` file must include the following:
  - `MONGO_URI`: Connection string to your MongoDB instance.
  - `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Node.js Version**: The project uses Node.js version `v22.9.0`, specified in the `.nvmrc` file for environment consistency.
- **Code Quality Tools**:
  - **Prettier**: For consistent code formatting.
  - **ESLint**: This is used to identify and fix JavaScript code issues.

### 2. **Frontend**
- **Framework**: Developed using **Next.js**.
- **State Management**: Configured with a **persistent Redux store** using **Thunk** middleware for efficient state management and asynchronous actions.
- **Placement**: The frontend code is located in the `frontend` folder within the repository.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js - Backend**: Ensure you have `v22.9.0` installed (recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)).
- **Node.js - Frontend**: Ensure you have `v20.18.1` installed (recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)).
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **MongoDB**: A running MongoDB instance (local or cloud).
- **Package Manager**: Either npm or yarn.

### Steps to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:fahad-git/green-market-place.git
   cd green-market-place
   ```

2. **Set Node Version**:
   ```bash
   nvm use
   ```
   If `nvm` is not installed, install Node.js version `v22.9.0` manually.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the root directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Repeat the process in the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   In the backend root directory, create a `.env` file and configure the following:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   ```
   Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, `<database-name>`, and `your-secret-key` with your specific details.

5. **Run the Backend**:
   In the root directory:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. **Run the Frontend**:
   In the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (default port for Next.js).

## Running Unit Tests

### Backend Unit Tests
The backend uses **Jest** and **Supertest** for unit and integration testing. Tests are located in the `tests` directory in the root folder.

1. **Install Testing Dependencies** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest supertest

2. **Run Testss**:
   ```bash
   npm test

This executes all test suites and generates a coverage report.

3. **Test Coverage:** To view detailed coverage:
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage

### Frontend Unit Tests
The frontend uses Jest and React Testing Library for testing components and Redux logic. Tests are located in the `frontend/tests` directory.

1. **Install Testing Dependencies** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
   
2. **Run Testss**:
   ```bash
   npm test

This runs all frontend test suites in watch mode (use `--watchAll=false` for CI environments).

3. **Test Coverage:** To view detailed coverage:
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
